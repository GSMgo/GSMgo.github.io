# Use your brain!

A tip from a programmer: Use your brain!

You've always heard that programmers are good at googling stuff, and that actually that is what we do every day, and that may be true. But, to be a good programmer absorve knowledge, you've gotta follow a different strategy.

Some programmers use google, stackoverlfow or any other code source as the first place to go to search for information, and this scenary would be the equivalent of plan A to be executed. But it shouldn't be, plan A should be using your brain, and the fallback plan will be to search for the answer. 90% of the time you'll be using the fallback plan, and thats OK, but always try to use the fallback plan after you apply plan A.

Two reasons of why you forget how to do things:

1. You've never used that specific knowledge in your life
2. You prefer to use external sources instead of using your head.

TIPIS:
- Think before googling!
- Read! Do not try to jump into conclusions... read and analyze the issue first!
